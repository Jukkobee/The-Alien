# Secondary Technical Specification

### Deferred Features (P2)

### GameManager
**Core Requirements:**
- Track current level number
- Manage barrier system
**Technical Components:**
- Level state tracker
- Barrier list implementation
**Dependencies:**
- HexGrid
- GameObject

### Player
**Core Requirements:**
- Track position on hex grid
- Handle direction facing
- Implement object dropping
**Technical Components:**
- HexCoordinate position system
- Direction vector manager
- Drop interaction handler
**Dependencies:**
- HexGrid
- GameObject

### GameObject
**Core Requirements:**
- Manage object visibility
- Update object state based on game events
**Technical Components:**
- Visibility toggle system
- State update handler
**Dependencies:**
- GameManager
- HexGrid

### HexGrid
**Core Requirements:**
- Maintain grid layout
- Track walkable positions
- Calculate neighbors
- Handle object placement
**Technical Components:**
- 2D Array grid system
- Walkable hex validator
- Neighbor calculation algorithm
- Position management system
**Dependencies:**
- GameObject
- Player

### Technical Debt Considerations
1. Movement system will need complete implementation when adding HexGrid
2. Object visibility system needs integration with game state
3. Level progression system requires proper state management
4. Position tracking system needs implementation for all game objects

### Future Implementation Notes
- HexGrid implementation should be prioritized when expanding game mechanics
- Movement system should be implemented after core gameplay is stable
- Visual effects and advanced state management can be added in later iterations
